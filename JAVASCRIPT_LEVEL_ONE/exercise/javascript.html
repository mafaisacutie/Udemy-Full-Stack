    <h1>Welcome to your First Exercise!</h1>
    <p>For this exercise we will be creating a weight metric converter
    <p>We will take in a number in pounds(lbs) and convert it to kilograms (kg). Right now we only<br>
    know enough to do this one way, but later on we will learn how to add logic to this sort of<br>
    problem!</p>
    <p>To complete this exercise do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Link this HTML file to your .js file</li>
      <li>Use JavaScript to accept a number input in pounds (lbs)</li>
      <li>Then in your jd file convert this number to kilograms (*0.454)</li>
      <li>Afterwards report back in an alert what the weight is in kg</li>
      <li>Then log/write "Conversion Completed" to the console</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
